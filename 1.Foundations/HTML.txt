# Understanding HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure of a website. It is the backbone of web development, allowing us to create organized and functional webpages by ensuring content is logically arranged and visually appealing. For example, a webpage can be structured with a header for the title, a main section for content, and a footer for additional information or navigation links.

## Key Concepts in HTML

### 1. Tags

Tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. While you can write raw text in the `index.html` file to render on a website, tags are essential to provide structure and meaning to the content. For example, plain text like "Welcome to my site" appears unformatted and lacks context, but using HTML tags such as `<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>` defines it as a header, giving it both structure and emphasis.

Here are some common HTML tags, grouped into categories for better understanding:

#### Structural Tags

- `<html>`: Defines the root of the HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata and links to external resources.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage.
- `<div>` / `<span>`: Used for grouping and styling sections of content. divs takes up the all the space available horizontally. spans only take up as much space as needed.

#### Header and Text Formatting Tags

- `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage displayed on the browser tab.
- `<h1>` - `<h6>`: Header tags, ranging from largest (`<h1>`) to smallest (`<h6>`).
- `<p>`: Paragraph tag for text.
- `<b>` / `<i>`: Bold and italicize text respectively.
- `<center>`: Centers content (deprecated; use CSS, such as `text-align: center;`, for centering instead).

#### Multimedia and Interactive Tags

- `<img>`: Displays images.

- `<a>`: Creates hyperlinks.

- `<input>`: Defines input fields in forms.

- `<button>`: Adds clickable buttons.

### 2. Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about tags and define their behavior. Each tag can have multiple attributes to customize its functionality.

Examples of attributes:

- `<img src="a.png">`: Specifies the source file for an image.
- `<a href="google.com">`: Defines the URL for a hyperlink.
- `<button onclick="">`: Specifies a JavaScript function to execute when the button is clicked.
- `<input id="username">`: Assigns an ID to the input field for styling or scripting purposes.

By combining tags and attributes, HTML allows developers to create structured, dynamic, and interactive webpages. For instance, a dynamic element could be a form that validates user input in real-time, while an interactive feature might be a button that displays a pop-up message when clicked.
