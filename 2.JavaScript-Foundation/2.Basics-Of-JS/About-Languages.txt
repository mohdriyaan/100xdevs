Why languages, Why were they introduced and why there are so many languages?

Before discussing languages, we will need to see how the computers work.
Every application that is your browser, movies, photos, etc is stored in the SSD. However once when we run the application, it runs in something called RAM.
Basically means the current things that are currently running on your machine resides in the RAM and everything else that's not currently running resides in the SSD.

But the question is when we want the application to run from SSD to RAM. What exactly goes into RAM?
Any final program that you run on your machine, be it a game or the fancy browser, in the end, what's running is the bunch of numbers that is 0's and 1's in the RAM.

Why a bunch of numbers?
Because the hardware dosen't really understand programming languages. It only has some sort of circuits, which can be either on or off. And since there can be only 2 states, they
are usually reperesented as zeroes and ones.

Does that mean the developers of application wrote zeroes and ones when they were writing source code?
No they probably wrote it either in Java, C++, JavaScript or some other language. 
Java, C++, JavaScript or some other language are high level languages in which we write code and all of them have compilers, which coverts this high level code into zeros and ones 
which actually go into your RAM and your machine can understand.
That is why we need languages because it will be much hard to write in zeros and ones.

There are so many languages because each have various optimizations and use cases can only be built in certain languages.
For Ex:- browser code or websites can only be written in HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
