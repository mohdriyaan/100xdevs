There are 2 types of languages:-
1. Single Threaded Language
2. Multi-Threaded Language

JS is famous for being single threaded language.JS is restricted to execute the processes to a single core at a time and cannot run multiple processes 
parallely in a single core rather it uses the context switching to run multiple processes. 
This is why it is considered to be a bad language for scalable systems.
