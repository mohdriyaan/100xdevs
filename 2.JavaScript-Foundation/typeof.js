let name = "ram";
console.log(typeof(name));  // string

let number = 4;
console.log(typeof(number));  // number

let valueChecked = true;
console.log(typeof(valueChecked));  // boolean

let a = null;
console.log(typeof(a));  // object
// typeof returned object for the null type. This has been a known issue in JavaScript since its first release.
