// JavaScript comments are annotations in the code that are completely ignored by the compiler. 

// In JavaScript, there are two ways to add comments to code:


/* As a JavaScript developer, you'll write code and also need to update code written by others.

If you write comments on your code, it will be easier for you to understand the code in the future. It will also be easier for your fellow developers to understand the code.

As a general rule of thumb, use comments to explain why you did something rather than how you did something. */
