What are compilers?
Compilers convert high level developer friendly code into 0's and 1's.
In C++, we will write the code first, then that sorce code file is compiled to generate a temp file which provides the output.

But JS is different. It is interpreted language.
In this case, it will covert the code into 0's and 1's line by line instead of compiling the whole file.

Differences between compiled languages and interpreted languages
Compiled Languages:- 1. First need to compile, then need to run
                     2. Usually don't compile if there is an error in code.
                     Ex:- C++, Rust, Java, GoLang.

Interpreted Languages:- 1. Usually go line by line.
                        2. Can run partially if error comes later
                        Ex:- JS, Python.
